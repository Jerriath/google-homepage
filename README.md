This is a simple html project that is meant to replicate the standard Google homepage. Most of the buttons have the correct functionality, however, not all of the buttons and inputs are implemented. 

The goal of this project is simply to practice html and css. This was just a project to get comfortable with working with html, css, as well as developer tools (firefox).
